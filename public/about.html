<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Geert-Jan Knapen, a webdeveloper from the Netherlands born in the roaring 20's (2001 that is, not 1920).</p>

<p>Been working as a back-end developer for a little over 2 years now, although I was originally educated as a full-stack developer..</p>

<p>Don't know what elso to add, I'm not quite interesting.</p>
